This is a pretty simple signup form index.html for mailchimp or similar 
services.

All you have to do is to add the code MailChimp provides to you when you
create a new campaign. You should also replace the logp, add some
description, modify the CSS and link to your social media sites.

To be honst, you could do this all by yourself - but you're welcome. ;)
